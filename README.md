dotfiles
========

My dotfiles, lots of old cruft in here.  Most important parts are my
Emacs and ZSH configs because that's where I spend most of my
(productive) time, as well as my scripts.  I've used seemingly every
DE and WM under the sun and have tried to make my settings as portable
and agnostic as possible while still being usable and comfy.
Currently back on i3 after a ~5 year venture elsewhere, haven't
bothered to check in my configs for it.  I've put way too much effort
into this shit over the years and most of it just doesn't matter.
Linux sucks, BSD sucks, Eunuchs sucks, Plan 9 sucks, I just want a
nice, coherent Smalltalk or Lisp environment to do everything in.
